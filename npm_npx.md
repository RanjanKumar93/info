`npx` is a command-line tool that comes with `npm` (starting from version 5.2.0). It is used to execute Node.js binaries directly from the command line without having to install them globally. This helps in running one-off commands and scripts that you don't need to install globally on your system, which can help in avoiding version conflicts and reducing clutter.

### Key Concepts:

- **`npm`**: Node Package Manager, which is used to install and manage packages (libraries, tools) in Node.js.
- **`npx`**: A tool for executing packages directly from the `node_modules` directory (local packages) or remotely without installing them globally.

### How `npx` Works:

- **Runs Local Packages**: If you have installed a package locally (i.e., within a project's `node_modules` folder), you can use `npx` to run it directly without needing to refer to the local `node_modules/.bin/` folder explicitly.

- **Runs Remote Packages**: You can run a package that you have not installed by using `npx`. It will download the package, execute it, and then remove it, ensuring that your global environment remains clean.

- **Avoids Global Installation**: For packages you only need to run once or infrequently, you don’t need to install them globally with `npm install -g`. Instead, you can run them directly with `npx`.

### Example Scenarios:

#### 1. Running a Local Package

Let’s say you have installed `eslint` locally within a project:

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

Now, instead of running `./node_modules/.bin/eslint`, you can simply use `npx`:

```bash
npx eslint .
```

This will execute `eslint` without requiring global installation.

#### 2. Running a Remote Package

Suppose you want to use `create-react-app` but don’t want to install it globally:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Here, `npx` downloads `create-react-app` if it is not already installed, runs it, and creates your React app.

#### 3. One-Time Use

Imagine you need to run a package just once. With `npx`, you don't need to install it. For example, running `nodemon` temporarily:

```bash
npx nodemon app.js
```

### Differences Between `npx` and Others:

1. **`npm install -g <package>`**:

   - **Global Installation**: This installs the package globally, making it available system-wide.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for tools that you need frequently or in multiple projects (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`).
   - **Drawback**: Potential version conflicts, cluttering your global environment.

2. **`npm install <package>`**:

   - **Local Installation**: This installs the package locally within a project.
   - **Use Case**: For project-specific dependencies.
   - **Drawback**: You need to manage the path to the local `node_modules` bin folder manually, or configure scripts in `package.json` to run them.

3. **`npx <package>`**:
   - **No Installation Required**: You can run a package without installing it globally or locally. For local packages, `npx` automatically handles the path.
   - **Use Case**: One-off package executions or running a package that is locally installed without needing to worry about the path.
   - **Benefit**: Keeps your environment clean and avoids global installations.
   - **Drawback**: Slightly slower than a globally installed package, as it needs to download or resolve the package on each run.

### Example Comparison:

1. **Using `npm install -g`**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

   This installs `http-server` globally and runs it.

2. **Using `npx`**:

   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

   This runs `http-server` without needing a global installation.

### When to Use `npx`:

- **One-time commands**: For example, initializing a project with `npx create-react-app`.
- **Avoiding global installs**: If you want to keep your global environment clean.
- **Running local project binaries**: To avoid manually dealing with paths in `node_modules`.

### Conclusion:

- **`npm install -g`**: Install a package globally, available across projects.
- **`npm install`**: Install a package locally, within the project.
- **`npx`**: Execute a package without installing it globally, or run local packages without manually handling paths.

If you’re looking to run a tool occasionally or just need to try something out, `npx` is the way to go. If you need a tool frequently, you may want to consider installing it globally.
