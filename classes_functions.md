### **Classes vs. Functions**

1. **Functions**:

   - Functions are primarily about data transformations.
   - They take some input, process it, and return an output.
   - Functions are great for scenarios where you are just performing operations on data, without the need to maintain any state or behavior across multiple invocations.
   - **Rule of thumb**: Use functions by default unless you need more complex behavior.

2. **Classes**:

   - Classes are used to model objects that have both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
   - Classes are particularly useful when you need to create something that is stateful or requires shared behavior across multiple objects.
   - **Common uses**: Classes are often used in video games, simulations, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where objects need to retain their state over time.

3. **When to Choose One Over the Other**:
   - **Default to functions**: If you’re not sure whether to use a class or a function, start with functions, especially for simpler tasks.
   - **Use classes**: If you find yourself dealing with complex systems where objects need to interact and retain state, or when inheritance and shared behavior across objects make your code more organized, classes might be the better option.

### **Key Differences**:

- **Functions**: Encourage thinking in terms of data transformations, focusing on inputs and outputs.
- **Classes**: Encourage thinking in terms of objects, bundling behavior, data, and state together, making it easier to manage complex systems.

### **Practical Advice**:

- Use what feels right in your projects.
- Don’t be afraid to refactor your code as your understanding and skills improve.

### Conclusion:

Classes and functions are tools that serve different purposes. Functions are usually simpler and best for straightforward tasks. Classes shine when dealing with complex, stateful systems that need structure and organization.

If you’re still unsure about when to use one over the other, start with functions and then refactor to classes as needed.
