In Solidity, the `override` keyword is used when a function or state variable in a contract overrides a function or state variable in a base contract or interface. It ensures that the developer explicitly indicates that the current function or state variable is meant to replace an inherited one.

In the context of your code, the contract `MyERC20` implements the `IERC20` interface. The `IERC20` interface defines a function `totalSupply()`, and your contract has its own version of the `totalSupply` state variable.

By using `override` before the `totalSupply` state variable in your contract, you're explicitly telling the compiler that this state variable is overriding the `totalSupply()` function declaration in the `IERC20` interface. This means that the `totalSupply()` function from the interface is being implemented by the `totalSupply` state variable in the `MyERC20` contract.

In summary, `override` is ensuring that `totalSupply` in `MyERC20` is recognized as the implementation of the `totalSupply()` function declared in the `IERC20` interface.

In Solidity, the `override` keyword is used when a derived contract wants to change (override) a function or modifier definition from its base contract(s). This is essential when dealing with inheritance and polymorphism in Solidity, ensuring that the correct version of a function is executed in case of conflicts between inherited contracts.

### 1. **Function Overriding in Single Inheritance**

In a simple inheritance scenario, a derived contract can override a function from its base contract using the `override` keyword.

#### Example:

```solidity
// Base contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Base {
    function sayHello() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Base";
    }
}

// Derived contract
contract Derived is Base {
    // Overriding the function from the base contract
    function sayHello() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Derived";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `virtual` keyword in the base contract indicates that the function can be overridden.
- The `override` keyword in the derived contract tells the compiler that this function is intentionally overriding the function in the base contract.

### 2. **Function Overriding in Multiple Inheritance**

When multiple base contracts are inherited, and each of them defines the same function (which the derived contract wants to override), the `override` keyword must be used along with all base contracts from which the function is inherited.

#### Example:

```solidity
// Base contract A
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract A {
    function greet() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from A";
    }
}

// Base contract B
contract B {
    function greet() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from B";
    }
}

// Derived contract inherits from both A and B
contract Derived is A, B {
    // Overriding the function from both base contracts
    function greet() public pure override(A, B) returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Derived";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Both `A` and `B` have the `greet` function marked as `virtual`, meaning that they can be overridden.
- The derived contract overrides `greet` and must specify which base contracts it is overriding using `override(A, B)`.

### 3. **Modifiers Overriding**

In addition to functions, you can also override modifiers in derived contracts.

#### Example:

```solidity
// Base contract with a modifier
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BaseModifier {
    modifier onlyOwner() virtual {
        // Base implementation
        _;
    }
}

// Derived contract overriding the modifier
contract DerivedModifier is BaseModifier {
    modifier onlyOwner() override {
        // Custom implementation
        _;
    }
}
```

### 4. **Calling Parent Contractsâ€™ Functions**

When overriding a function in a derived contract, you can call the base contract's version using the following syntax:

```solidity
// Base contract
contract Parent {
    function sayHello() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Parent";
    }
}

// Derived contract
contract Child is Parent {
    function sayHello() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return string(abi.encodePacked(super.sayHello(), " and Child"));
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `super` keyword calls the base contract's `sayHello` function.
- The derived contract extends the functionality by adding additional behavior to the base function.

### 5. **Abstract Contracts and Interfaces**

In Solidity, when a function in a contract is marked `virtual` but does not have a body, it is considered abstract. Any contract inheriting such an abstract contract must implement (override) the abstract function.

#### Example with Abstract Contract:

```solidity
// Abstract contract
abstract contract AbstractContract {
    function greet() public virtual returns (string memory);
}

// Derived contract implementing the abstract function
contract ConcreteContract is AbstractContract {
    function greet() public override returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from ConcreteContract";
    }
}
```

#### Example with Interface:

```solidity
// Interface
interface IGreeter {
    function greet() external view returns (string memory);
}

// Contract implementing the interface
contract Greeter is IGreeter {
    function greet() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Greeter";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Abstract contracts and interfaces serve as blueprints, and their functions must be implemented by any derived contract.
- The `override` keyword is mandatory in both cases.

### 6. **Multiple Levels of Inheritance**

Solidity supports multilevel inheritance, where a derived contract inherits from another derived contract. In such cases, each contract can override the inherited functions, and each level needs to specify `override`.

#### Example:

```solidity
// Contract A
contract A {
    function foo() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {
        return "A";
    }
}

// Contract B inheriting from A
contract B is A {
    function foo() public pure virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return "B";
    }
}

// Contract C inheriting from B
contract C is B {
    function foo() public pure override returns (string memory) {
        return "C";
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

- **`virtual`**: This keyword allows a function or modifier to be overridden.
- **`override`**: This keyword is used in the derived contract to indicate that the function or modifier is overriding the base version.
- **Multiple Inheritance**: When inheriting from multiple base contracts, you need to specify all base contracts in the `override` keyword.
- **Abstract Contracts**: If a contract has a function marked `virtual` but with no implementation, the contract is abstract, and the function must be overridden in derived contracts.

These are the key concepts related to overriding in Solidity.
