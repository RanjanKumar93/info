### Overview

The article describes an attack vector on the ERC20 token standard, specifically targeting the `approve` and `transferFrom` methods. The vulnerability arises due to the potential race condition where a spender can transfer more tokens than the owner intended.

### Key Points:

1. **`approve` and `transferFrom` Methods:**

   - `approve`: Allows an account to authorize another account (spender) to withdraw tokens up to a certain limit.
   - `transferFrom`: Enables a spender to transfer tokens from the owner’s account to another account, within the approved limit.

2. **The Vulnerability:**
   The issue arises when an owner (like Alice) changes the allowance for a spender (like Bob). If the spender acts quickly between two allowance changes, they can transfer more tokens than intended.

### Attack Scenario:

1. **Step 1:** Alice approves Bob to transfer `N` tokens by calling `approve(Bob, N)`.
2. **Step 2:** Alice later decides to change Bob’s allowance to `M` tokens, so she calls `approve(Bob, M)`.
3. **Step 3:** Bob, noticing Alice’s second transaction (before it is mined), quickly calls `transferFrom` to withdraw `N` tokens.
4. **Step 4:** Once Alice’s second transaction (changing allowance to `M`) is mined, Bob is able to withdraw another `M` tokens.
   - **Result:** Bob successfully withdraws `N + M` tokens, more than Alice intended to allow.

### Code Example of Vulnerability

```solidity
// Vulnerable ERC20 Contract
contract ERC20Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Not enough allowance");
        require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Not enough balance");

        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
}
```

In this contract:

- Alice approves Bob to spend `N` tokens by calling `approve(Bob, N)`.
- Bob calls `transferFrom` twice to transfer more than Alice wanted, exploiting the race condition.

### Mitigation Workarounds

#### 1. **Approve 0 First**

A common mitigation strategy is to first set the spender’s allowance to 0 before updating it to the new value. For example:

```solidity
// First, reset allowance to 0
approve(Bob, 0);

// Then, set new allowance
approve(Bob, M);
```

This makes sure that Bob can't transfer the previous allowance (`N`) before the new allowance (`M`) is set. However, this solution is not foolproof because Bob can still act quickly between these two transactions.

#### 2. **Advanced Approval Logic: Compare and Set**

To prevent this, you can implement an atomic "compare and set" operation for approval. Here’s how the improved function would look:

```solidity
// Improved ERC20 Contract with atomic approve
contract ImprovedERC20Token {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _currentValue, uint256 _newValue) public returns (bool success) {
        // Only approve the new value if the current allowance matches _currentValue
        if (allowance[msg.sender][_spender] == _currentValue) {
            allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _newValue;
            emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _newValue);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Not enough allowance");
        require(balances[_from] >= _value, "Not enough balance");

        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_from] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
}
```

In this version:

- **Atomicity:** The allowance is only updated if the current allowance is equal to what was expected. This prevents race conditions since both transactions need to pass the condition at the same time, which is improbable.
- This atomicity ensures that Bob cannot exploit the gap between allowance changes.

### Suggested Changes to ERC20 API:

1. **Atomic `approve` Method:**  
   Adding a new `approve` method that checks the current allowance before changing it ensures that an attacker cannot perform a race condition attack.

2. **Separate Transfer Event for `transferFrom`:**  
   Creating a separate event that logs `transferFrom` operations allows for more transparency and easier auditing of token transfers initiated by a third party.

3. **Four-Argument `Approval` Event:**  
   Adding the `oldValue` field in the `Approval` event provides more context and can be useful for tracking allowance changes and detecting potential attacks.

### Conclusion

The described attack is a real vulnerability in the ERC20 standard, and while workarounds like resetting the allowance to 0 before changing it exist, a more robust solution involves adding an atomic `approve` method to prevent race conditions.
