In Go, the `*` symbol is used in two main contexts related to pointers:

1. **Dereferencing**: Accessing the value that the pointer points to.
2. **Pointer Declaration**: Declaring a pointer type.

### 1. **Pointer Declaration**

When you declare a variable as a pointer, you use `*` to specify that the variable holds the memory address of another variable, rather than the value itself. For example:

```go
var x int = 10
var ptr *int = &x  // ptr is a pointer to an int, holding the address of x
```

Here, `ptr` is a pointer to an `int`, and it stores the memory address of `x`.

### 2. **Dereferencing**

To access or modify the value that a pointer is pointing to, you use `*` to dereference it. Dereferencing a pointer gives you the value stored at the address that the pointer holds. For example:

```go
fmt.Println(*ptr)  // Output: 10, accessing the value of x through ptr

*ptr = 20          // Changing the value of x through ptr
fmt.Println(x)     // Output: 20, x has been updated to 20
```

### Explanation of the `depositMoney` Function

Let's break down the `depositMoney` function to understand how pointers and dereferencing are used:

```go
func depositMoney(balance *float64) error {
	var depositAmount float64
	fmt.Print("Enter deposit amount: ")
	_, err := fmt.Scan(&depositAmount)

	if err != nil || depositAmount <= 0 {
		return errors.New(invalidDepositAmount)
	}

	*balance += depositAmount  // Dereferencing the pointer to access and modify the balance
	fmt.Println("Deposit successful! New balance:", *balance)
	return writeBalanceToFile(*balance)
}
```

#### Key Points:

1. **Pointer Parameter**:

   - `balance *float64`: Here, `balance` is a pointer to a `float64`. This means `balance` holds the memory address of a `float64` variable.
   - Using a pointer allows the function to modify the original variable passed to it. If `balance` were not a pointer, changes made to it inside the function would not affect the original variable.

2. **Dereferencing**:

   - `*balance`: When you use `*balance`, you are dereferencing the pointer, which means you are accessing and modifying the `float64` value stored at the address that `balance` points to.
   - `*balance += depositAmount`: This line adds the `depositAmount` to the value that `balance` points to. If `balance` were pointing to a variable `accBalance` with a value of `100.0`, and `depositAmount` is `50.0`, this operation would change `accBalance` to `150.0`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - `writeBalanceToFile(*balance)`: The function `writeBalanceToFile` takes a `float64` value as an argument. `*balance` dereferences the pointer to get the actual `float64` value to pass to the function.

### Example Scenario

Letâ€™s say you have a `balance` variable in `main` and you pass its pointer to `depositMoney`:

```go
func main() {
    balance := 100.0
    depositMoney(&balance)
    fmt.Println("Updated Balance in main:", balance) // This will reflect changes
}
```

In this example:

- `&balance` gets the memory address of `balance`, and this address is passed to `depositMoney`.
- Inside `depositMoney`, `balance` is a pointer to `100.0`. By using `*balance`, you can modify `balance` to `150.0` (if `depositAmount` is `50.0`).
- After `depositMoney` returns, the updated balance is reflected in `main` because `balance` was modified through its pointer.

This is a powerful feature in Go that allows functions to modify variables defined outside their scope efficiently.
