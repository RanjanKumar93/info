If you want to uninstall Visual Studio Code only within your Ubuntu WSL environment without affecting your Windows installation, follow these steps:

### Steps to Uninstall Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu WSL:

1. **Open your Ubuntu WSL Terminal:**
   - Open the **Ubuntu WSL** terminal by searching for "Ubuntu" in your Start menu.

2. **Remove Visual Studio Code:**
   - If you installed Visual Studio Code using the package manager (`apt`), you can uninstall it with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt remove code
     ```
   - If you want to also remove the configuration files related to VS Code, use this command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt purge code
     ```

3. **Remove Extensions and Configuration Files (Optional):**
   - To remove any extensions and configuration files specific to your WSL environment, delete the `.vscode` and `.config/Code` directories in your home folder:
     ```bash
     rm -rf ~/.vscode
     rm -rf ~/.config/Code
     ```

4. **Update Package List:**
   - After removing VS Code, it is a good practice to update your package list:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

This will completely uninstall Visual Studio Code from your Ubuntu WSL environment while keeping your Windows installation intact.
